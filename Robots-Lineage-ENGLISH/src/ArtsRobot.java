 * The ArtsRobot class represents a robot that is specialized in arts-related tasks.

 * to include the discipline of the robot as "Arts".
 * 
 * The robot's name and serial number can be accessed or modified through its public
 * getter and setter methods. This class is abstract and cannot be instantiated on its own.
